## Ideas

These are my general ideas for things I want to do either with programming or something in general

#### Programming Ideas
- DND Dungeon Generator
	- Ability to input # of characters and other variables and it will set the challenge rating accordingly
- Tamogachi
	- Either CLI or GUI (Likely CLI first)
- [Dumb Acronym Generator](https://github.com/littlediobolic/DAG) :heavy_check_mark:
	- Takes a given tech acronym and will generate a dumb full name randomly from a dictionary.
	- EX: (IP - Insufferable Pandas)
- Un-motivational poster generator
	- Grabs a mean phrase and finds a peaceful poster to go with it
- Morse code chat bot
	- Discord
	- Slack
	- ext
- Minecraft Skin Grabber
- Open Source "Mario Maker"
	- Obvioulsy way out of my league but a man can dream
- Some form of boids, more than likely 2D and stupid simple
- Auto Texting to text my girlfriend good morning
        - Will pick from random good morning messages
	- Doesnt text if I have already messaged her this morning

- Incremental Game
